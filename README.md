# GODEL: Large-Scale Pre-Training for Goal-Directed Dialog

## News

(Update 10/23/2022) We have released GODEL V1.1, which is trained on 551M multi-turn dialogs from Reddit discussion thread, and 5M instruction and knowledge grounded dialogs. It has shown significantly better results on our benchmark, especially in the zero-shot setting.

Please check out our model cards in the huggingface Transformers repository. With several lines of code, it should be pretty straightforward to chat with GODEL. A live demo is shown [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/GODEL-Demo)

## Introduction
This repository showcases **building goal-directed dialog** using GODEL, and contains the dataset, source code and pre-trained model for the following paper:


[GODEL: Large-Scale Pre-Training for Goal-Directed Dialog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/godel-large-scale-pre-training-for-goal-directed-dialog/)<br>Baolin Peng, Michel Galley, Pengcheng He, Chris Brockett, Lars Liden, Elnaz Nouri, Zhou Yu, Bill Dolan, Jianfeng Gao

GODEL is a large-scale pre-trained model for goal-directed dialogs. It is parameterized with a Transformer-based encoder-decoder model and trained for response generation grounded in external text, which allows more effective fine-tuning on dialog tasks that require conditioning the response on information that is external to the current conversation (e.g., a retrieved document). The pre-trained model can be efficiently fine-tuned and adapted to accomplish a new dialog task with a handful of task-specific dialogs.

This repository is based on Hugginface Transformers. Some evaluation scripts and dataset are adapted from [DSTC7-End-to-End-Conversation-Modeling](data/grounded), [DialoGPT](data/ungrounded), [UnifiedQA](https://github.com/allenai/unifiedqa), [MS MARCO](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/), [MultiWOZ](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz), [Schema-Guided Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dstc8-schema-guided-dialogue), etc.

The included scripts can be used to reproduce the results reported in the paper. Project and demo webpage: [https://aka.ms/GODEL](https://aka.ms/GODEL)

## Installation 
**Requires** The interactive interface requries *node.js* and *npm*. Please refer to [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for installation.

Please use the below commands to create the environment, clone the repo and install required packages.
```
conda create -n godel-env python=3.8
conda activate godel-env
conda install nodejs
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/GODEL.git
cd GODEL
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH="`pwd`"
```
Fetch and unzip the pretrained model based on which to continue finetune your own data.  

```zsh
wget https://bapengstorage.blob.core.windows.net/fileshare/godel_base.tar.gz
tar -zxvf godel_base.tar.gz
```
## Pipeline
**Data format**
```json
  {
    "Context": "Please remind me of calling to Jessie at 2PM.",
    "Knowledge": "reminder_contact_name is Jessie, reminder_time is 2PM",
    "Response": "Sure, set the reminder: call to Jesse at 2PM"
  },
```
We use json format to represent a training example. As shown in the above example, it contains the following fields:
* **Context** - The context from session beginning to current turn.
* **Knowledge** - External or environment state represented in plain text.
* **Reponse** - The target agent respose. It can be a template, an api call or natural language.

**Fine-tuning**
```Bash
DATA_NAME={path_of_data}
OUTPUT_DIR={path_of_fine-tuned_model}
MODEL_PATH={path_of_pre-trained_model}
EXP_NAME={experiment_name}

python train.py --model_name_or_path ${MODEL_PATH} \
	--dataset_name ${DATA_NAME} \
	--output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR} \
	--per_device_train_batch_size=16 \
	--per_device_eval_batch_size=16 \
	--max_target_length 512 \
	--max_length 512 \
	--num_train_epochs 50 \
	--save_steps 10000 \
	--num_beams 5 \
	--exp_name ${EXP_NAME} --preprocessing_num_workers 24
```


**Generation**
```python
DATA_NAME={path_of_data}
OUTPUT_DIR={path_to_save_predictions}
MODEL_PATH={path_of_fine-tuned_model}

python generate.py --model_name_or_path ${MODEL_PATH}  \
	--dataset_name ${DATA_NAME}  \
	--output_dir ${OUTPUT_DIR}  \
	--per_device_eval_batch_size=16  \
	--max_target_length 128 \
	--max_length 512  \
	--preprocessing_num_workers 24  \
	--num_beams 5 
```

**Interaction**  

We provide a demo interface to chat with finetuned models. The backend server is based on *flask* and the interface is based on *vue*, *bootstrap-vue*, and *BasicVueChat*.

Simple jupiter notebook:

[Notebook](https://github.com/AlexWortega/GODEL/blob/main/jupiters/godel_faststart.ipynb)

Start the backend server:
```bash
# Please create the backend server refering to e.g., dstc9_server.py
python EXAMPLE_server.py # start the sever and expose 8080 
```

Start serving frontend page:
```bash
cd GODEL/html
npm install
npm run serve 
```
Open localhost:8080 in your web browser, you will see the following page. Note that the backend port should be consistent with the port used in html/compoents/chat.vue.

A live demo is shown [here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/GODEL-Demo)

## Models

We have released GODEL V1.1, which is trained on 551M multi-turn dialogs from Reddit discussion thread and 5M instruction and knowledge-grounded dialogs. More models will be released later.

~~We have released three fine-tuned models which can be further fine-tuned on low-resource user-customized dataset. The total parameters in these models range from 117M to 2.7B.~~

## Training

5/22/2023: Pretraining GODEL models with our codebase is no longer supported, but GODEL models remain available. See [here](TRAIN.md) for details.

### Fine-tuning and Evaluation

GODEL is fine-tuned and evaluated on four tasks. We provide scripts to create training and testing data in our format. Please refer to *create_downstream_dataset.sh* to download the original data and execute the following cmd.

```Bash
cd scripts 
./create_downstream_dataset.sh
```

```Bash

## Tutorial - Adding a new task using GODEL

In this tutorial, you will build a grounded dialog model based on GODEL for DSTC9 task. Detailed information can be found at [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-with-dstc9-track1-dataset).

Firstly download the data and convert it to GODEL format.
```bash
cd examples/dstc9
./create_data.sh
```
*Finetune with the pre-trained GODEL model*
```bash
cd GODEL 
GODEL_MODEL={path_to_pre-trained_model}
python train.py 
	--model_name_or_path ${GODEL_MODEL}   \
	--dataset_name ../examples/dstc9/dstc9_dataset.py   \
	--output_dir ../examples/dstc9/ckpt   \
	--per_device_train_batch_size=16  \
	--per_device_eval_batch_size=16  \
	--max_target_length 128  \
	--max_length 512  \
	--num_train_epochs 50  \
	--save_steps 10000  \
	--num_beams 5  \
	--exp_name wow-test \
	--preprocessing_num_workers 24 \
	--save_every_checkpoint 
```
*Interact with above trained model*
```bash
cd examples/dstc9
# replace model path in dstc9_server with a trained ckpt in line 49
python dstc9_server.py

cd GODEL/html 
npm install
npm run serve
```

## Disclaimer
This repository aims to facilitate research in a paradigm shift of building task bots at scale. This toolkit contains only part of the modeling machinery needed to actually produce a model weight file in a running dialog. On its own, this model provides only information about the weights of various text spans; in order for a researcher to actually use it, they will need to bring in-house conversational data of their own for future pre-training and decode the response generation from the pretrained/finetuned system. Microsoft is not responsible for any generation from the 3rd party utilization of the pretrained system.
